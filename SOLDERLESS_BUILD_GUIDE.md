## 🔧 Option 1: Breadboard Build (Recommended)

### Parts You Need

**1. ESP32 DevKit Board**
- Any 30-pin ESP32-WROOM-32 DevKit
- Make sure it has 15 pins on each side
- $5-6 on Amazon/AliExpress

**2. Passive Piezo Buzzer Module**
Look for modules with **3 pins** (VCC, GND, I/O):
- **KY-006** Passive Buzzer Module ~$1-2
- **XY-T** Passive Buzzer Module ~$1-2
- Any "passive piezo buzzer module" with 3 pins

**Important:** Get "passive" not "active"! 
- ✅ **Passive** = can play different tones (what we need)
- ❌ **Active** = only one tone (won't work)

**3. Breadboard & Jumpers**
- 400-point breadboard (standard half-size)
- 3× male-to-male jumper wires
- Any color works, but red/black/yellow helps

### Assembly Steps

**Step 1: Insert ESP32 into Breadboard**
```
   Breadboard Layout (top view)
   ═══════════════════════════════
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │  1  2  3  4  5 ... 15       │
   │  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ...  ●      │ ← ESP32 Left Side
   │                             │
   │  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●  ...  ●      │ ← ESP32 Right Side
   │  1  2  3  4  5 ... 15       │
   └─────────────────────────────┘
```

1. Straddle the ESP32 across the center gap
2. Push down gently but firmly
3. All 30 pins should be inserted

**Step 2: Connect Buzzer Module**

Buzzer modules typically have 3 pins:
- **S** or **I/O** = Signal pin
- **VCC** or **+** = Power (3.3V or 5V)
- **GND** or **-** = Ground

**Wiring:**
```
ESP32 DevKit          Buzzer Module
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    GPIO 25  ────────► S (Signal/I/O)
    
    3V3      ────────► VCC (+) or (leave unconnected*)
    
    GND      ────────► GND (-)
```

**Important Note:** Most passive buzzer modules are "self-powered" from the signal pin and don't need VCC. If yours has only 2 pins (S and GND), that's normal - just connect those two.

**Step 3: Insert Jumper Wires**

Using 3 male-to-male jumpers:

1. **GPIO 25 → Buzzer S**
   - Find GPIO 25 on ESP32 (usually labeled)
   - Insert one jumper end in same row as GPIO 25
   - Insert other end in Buzzer S pin row

2. **GND → Buzzer GND**
   - Find any GND pin on ESP32
   - Insert jumper in same row as GND
   - Insert other end in Buzzer GND pin row

3. **3V3 → Buzzer VCC** (optional, see note above)
   - Only if your buzzer has 3 pins
   - Connect 3V3 to VCC if buzzer requires it

**Visual Reference:**

```

**Step 4: Connect USB Cable**
- Plug micro USB cable into ESP32
- Connect to computer
- LED on ESP32 should light up

### Testing

1. Power on (ESP32 LED lights up)
2. Flash firmware: `pio run -t upload`
3. Monitor serial: `pio device monitor`
4. Should hear 6-note startup tune (Super Mario 1-2)
5. LED flashes when WiFi traffic detected
6. Buzzer chirps on Flock camera detection

**No sound?** See troubleshooting below.

## 🔌 Option 3: Qwiic/STEMMA Build

Similar to Grove but uses I2C... except we're wiring it manually to GPIO 25.

### Parts You Need

**1. ESP32 DevKit (any)**
- Standard 30-pin ESP32
- $5-6

**2. Qwiic/STEMMA Buzzer Breakout**
- SparkFun Qwiic Buzzer (~$7)
- Or Adafruit STEMMA-compatible buzzer
- Comes with Qwiic cable

**3. Female-to-Female Jumpers**
- 3× jumpers to adapt Qwiic to GPIO
- $1 for pack of 40

### Assembly Steps

**Step 1: Identify Qwiic Buzzer Pins**

Qwiic buzzers usually have:
- **SIG** = Signal
- **VCC** = 3.3V or 5V
- **GND** = Ground
- **I2C pins** = (ignore, we're using SIG)

**Step 2: Wire with Jumpers**

```
ESP32 Pin   →  Female Jumper  →  Buzzer Pin
━━━━━━━───────────────────────────━━━━━━━━
GPIO 25     →  (any color)    →  SIG
GND         →  Black          →  GND  
3V3         →  Red            →  VCC (optional)
```

1. Take 3 female-to-female jumpers
2. Plug one end into ESP32 GPIO 25 pin
3. Plug other end into Buzzer SIG pin
4. Repeat for GND and VCC (if needed)

**Why Qwiic?**
- Compact, professional modules
- Same ecosystem as SparkFun/Adafruit
- Easier to expand with other sensors later

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Startup Sound

**Possible causes:**

1. **Active vs Passive Buzzer**
   - **Problem:** You have an "active" buzzer (won't play tones)
   - **Solution:** Order a "passive" buzzer module
   - **How to tell:** Active buzzers have a black chip on back

2. **Wrong GPIO Pin**
   - **Problem:** Buzzer connected to wrong pin
   - **Solution:** Verify GPIO 25 connection (count from end)
   - **Check:** Use multimeter or LED to test pin

3. **Power Issue**
   - **Problem:** USB port not providing enough current
   - **Solution:** Try powered USB hub or different port
   - **Check:** Does onboard ESP32 LED light up?

4. **Buzzer Polarity**
   - **Problem:** Some passive buzzers are polarized
   - **Solution:** Swap the Signal and GND wires
   - **Test:** Try both orientations

5. **Firmware Not Using GPIO 25**
   - **Problem:** Old firmware version
   - **Solution:** Re-download latest main.cpp
   - **Verify:** Check line 12 has `#define BUZZER_PIN 25`

### Buzzer Sounds Distorted

**Causes & Fixes:**

- **Too much current:** Add 100Ω resistor between GPIO 25 and buzzer Signal
- **Wrong voltage:** Some buzzers need 5V, try connecting VCC to VIN (5V) instead of 3V3
- **EMI interference:** Move buzzer away from ESP32 antenna area

### Connection Keeps Falling Out

**Breadboard connections:**
- Insert pins fully - should feel firm
- If loose, try different breadboard rows
- Clean pin legs with isopropyl alcohol

**Grove connections:**
- Push connector in firmly until it clicks
- Cable might be backwards - try flipping it
- Check for bent pins in connector

### Need to Disable Buzzer Temporarily?

Edit `main.cpp` line 13:
```cpp
#define USE_BUZZER 0  // Change 1 to 0
```

Re-upload firmware. LED still works for visual feedback.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Color-Code Your Wires
- **Red** = Power (3V3 or VCC)
- **Black** = Ground (GND)
- **Yellow** = Signal (GPIO 25)

Makes troubleshooting easier!

### Tip 2: Test Buzzer First
Before assembling, test buzzer independently:
```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(25, OUTPUT);
  tone(25, 1000);  // 1kHz tone
  delay(1000);
  noTone(25);
}
```

Should hear 1 second beep.

### Tip 3: Secure for Vehicle Use
If using in a car:
- Use velcro strips to mount breadboard
- Zip-tie USB cable for strain relief
- Consider Grove system for vibration resistance

### Tip 4: Battery Power
For portable use without USB:
- Use 18650 battery holder with 5V boost
- Connect to ESP32 VIN pin (5V input)
- Typical runtime: 6-8 hours
