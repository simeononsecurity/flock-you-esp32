## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Order Pre-Assembled (Easiest)

1. **Get PCB Files:**
   - Have the schematic converted to KiCad Gerber files (~$50-100)
   - Or design yourself in KiCad (free software)

2. **Order from JLCPCB:**
   - Upload Gerber files
   - Enable SMT Assembly
   - Upload BOM and CPL files
   - Wait 7-10 days for delivery

3. **Flash Firmware:**
   ```bash
   cd flock-you-esp32
   source venv/bin/activate
   pio run -t upload
   ```

4. **Done!** Device is ready to use.

See **ASSEMBLY_GUIDE.md** for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Hand-Assemble (Advanced)

If you have a hot air station and soldering skills:

1. Order bare PCBs ($2 for 5 boards from JLCPCB)
2. Buy components from LCSC/AliExpress (~$8 per board)
3. Assemble using hot air station + soldering iron
4. Total cost: ~$10 per board

See **SCHEMATIC.md** for pinout and assembly notes.

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need PCB design skills?
No! You can hire someone on Fiverr to convert the schematic to KiCad for $50-100. Provide them with SCHEMATIC.md and they'll create the Gerber files.

### Can I sell assembled devices?
Yes! This is open-source hardware. Consider pricing at $49-69 retail to compete with the $149 commercial OUI-SPY while making good profit.

### How many should I order for first batch?
Order 5 boards ($60 total) to test. If they work well, order 20-50 for volume pricing (~$7-8 per board).

### What if parts go out of stock?
The BOM includes JLCPCB Basic parts (highly stocked). If something is unavailable, the schematic has notes on compatible replacements.

### Can I modify the design?
Absolutely! Fork it, improve it, share your changes. Consider adding:
- Battery power (LiPo + charger IC)
- External antenna (u.FL connector)
- SD card slot (for GPS logging)
- RGB LED (for fancy status indicators)

### Will this pass FCC/CE certification?
Not without additional testing and design changes (proper shielding, filtering). This is a hobbyist/research device.
