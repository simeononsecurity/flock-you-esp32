// ble_selftest.h — optional on-device BLE self-test (BLE_SELF_TEST=1 only).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS:
// Validating the BLE-only detection pipeline end-to-end (real NimBLE
// advertisement parsing -> fyProcessBLEAdvertisedDevice() matching ->
// enqueueAlert() -> drainAlertQueue() -> LED/chirp/JSON) normally requires a
// SECOND physical BLE transmitter (e.g. beacon_test.cpp on a separate board)
// broadcasting one of the three Flock BLE signatures. When only one board
// is available, this lets that SAME board briefly advertise each signature
// itself; its own continuous NimBLE scan (BLE_COEX_MODE) picks the
// advertisement back up, exercising the exact real parsing/matching code a
// genuine external Flock BLE signal would.
//
// ROOT CAUSE OF THE FREEZE (found via on-device testing, v1 + v2 both hung):
// bleSelfTestFire() used to call `g_pBLEScan->start(N, false)` to run a
// short dedicated scan window overlapping the advertising burst. With an
// int + bool argument list, that call resolves to NimBLEScan's *blocking*
// overload — `NimBLEScanResults start(uint32_t duration, bool is_continue)`
// — NOT the async duration-limited one. The blocking overload parks the
// CALLING task (main loop!) in `ulTaskNotifyTake(pdTRUE, portMAX_DELAY)` and
// only returns if something calls `stop()` (which gives the task
// notification) or the internal duration-complete GAP event does so. Our
// own later `stop()` call was racing the scan's own duration timer, and in
// practice the notify was never delivered — main loop hung forever, with
// zero further serial output, exactly matching what was observed on
// hardware (one "BLE-Flock rssi=..." line from the BLE host task, then
// silence).
//
// THE FIX: don't touch the scanner at all. BLE_COEX_MODE already keeps a
// continuous (duration=0, non-blocking) scan running at all times via
// bleCoexStart()/bleScanTick() in main.cpp — it already proved (in the very
// first test) that it catches our own self-advertised packet perfectly
// fine while running concurrently. bleSelfTestFire() now ONLY starts/stops
// *advertising*; the always-on scan does the rest, identically to how it
// would pick up a real external Flock BLE device.
//
// MAC ROTATION: real Flock BLE beacons aren't expected to rotate their
// address, but a fixed self-test address made every capture look identical
// and made it hard to tell scenarios apart in logs. Each burst now
// generates a fresh random static BLE address (host-stack "static random"
// address, distinct from the chip's real public address) before
// advertising, and restores the public address type afterward so the
// device's real identity is unaffected everywhere else (WiFi MAC, BLE
// scanning, etc. are untouched by this).
//
// Enable via: -DBLE_SELF_TEST=1  (see platformio.ini's *-selftest envs)
// NEVER define this in a production build -- the device would self-report
// fake "detections" it generated itself, defeating the point of a detector.

// the fixed public address. Briefly stopping the scan just for the
// randomize+advertise window (then restarting it with the same
// overload-safe async call bleCoexStart() uses) fixes this without
// giving up continuous scanning for more than this single burst's
// duration -- self-test builds are never used as real detectors anyway
// (see file-level warning above), so this brief pause is harmless here.
